# Flutter Web Codelab (pt. 1) - Introduction to Flutter Web

## Overview

Welcome to the exciting world of Flutter Web!

**Flutter** is an open-source UI Toolkit supported by Google for building beautiful, natively-compiled user interfaces in a multi-platform fashion, using **Dart**, another open-source programming language supported by Google, as its language.

**Flutter for Web** provides the lowest barrier to entry when it comes to becoming a profilic Flutter developer. Most of the concepts learned in Flutter can be applied in a multi-platform scenario, and web is not an exception, so join us in building compelling web apps by going through the codelabs in this series.

### NOTE: THIS IS NOT A BEGINNER CODELAB

(If you're looking for more beginner content, please visit some of my other codelabs [here](https://romanjustcodes.web.app/#/workshops)). If you're up for the challenge, then proceed.

This is a codelab series focused on Flutter Web, in which you'll learn the following:
